# react-sample
First real React application that was developed by me. This was created without the use of create-react-app since I wanted to understand how Webpack + Babel + React all work together. Used to understand and practice the fundamentals of React.

### This application simply calls the GitHub API and will have three areas: 
### 1. Popular GitHub Repos (w/ 5 languages to choose from)
### 2. Profile Lookup (will look up a GitHub username and render a simple profile card 
### 3. Github Battle (Put two GitHub users up against each other. Algorithm will spit out the "better" user)
